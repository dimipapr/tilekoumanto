## Operator certificate material

Generated certificate material is written to the top-level `certs/` directory.

The `certs/` directory is ignored by git and treated as local environment state.

Generated device certificate identities are UUIDs.

## MQTT listeners

The Mosquitto deployment uses two listeners:

- port `1883` for internal Docker-network backend traffic
- port `8883` for external edge-device MQTT over mTLS with client certificates required
